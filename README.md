# CS61C-fa20-proj1

This repository contains my solutions to the CS61C-fa20-proj1: Conway's Game of Life, in RGB.

# Introduction

- [x] Part A1
    * write the functions readData, writeData, and freeImage, which will be used to convert between the Image struct and .ppm files.
- [x] Part A2
    * Steganography is the process of hiding a message in an image or similar file. In this exercise, we will explore one way in which we can hide a message.
- [x] Part B
    * implementation will read in an ASCII full-color (24-bit) image and the rules for the variant of the Game of Life you wish to simulate, and print (to STDOUT) another ASCII full-color image of one iteration of the simulation.
